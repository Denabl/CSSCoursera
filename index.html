    <h1>Wildlife in Costa Rica</h1>

  <main id="main_content">
    <p>In June of 2024, I traveled to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">Costa Rica</a> for about 9 days. It was my first solo trip outside of a work trip, and I didn't speak the language! I decided not to rent a car,
    so I used uber, taxis, public transit, and shuttles (and one boat) to get around. I decided to bring my Canon 5D MkIII to capture the wildlife better than a phone would. I brought a 24-105mm lens and a 70-300mm lens, though a longer
    one would certainly have been helpful at times!</p>

    

    <p>Honestly, one of the most daunting parts of the trip was planning it, which I did at the last minute, with some much-needed help (thanks Kelly). It turned out that many activities could be booked day-of or just the day before,
    though there were times when things like tours required at least two people. By the time the trip was finished, I was relieved I didn't have to make any decisions for a while.</p>

    <p>I met some wonderful people in the three different places I stayed (in 2 cities), got caught in some epic storms, and saw some staggeringly beautiful wildlife. I hope you enjoy some of the photos I took of the birds and other animals! </p>
