  <main id="main_content">
    <p>In June of 2024, I traveled to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">Costa Rica</a> for about 9 days. It was my first solo trip outside of a work trip, and I didn't speak the language!  </p>

    <p>Honestly, one of the most daunting parts of the trip was planning it, which I did at the last minute, with some much-needed help (thanks Kelly).</p>
    <p>I met some wonderful people in the three different places I stayed (in 2 cities), and saw some staggeringly beautiful wildlife. </p>
